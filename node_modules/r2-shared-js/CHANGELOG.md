* fix: encryption.xml with percent-encoded URIs (decode before compare with WebPubManifest already-decoded by package.opf XML-to-JSON converter)
* fix: encrypted TOC is ignored
* fix (workaround): linear=no in fixed layout publications is ignored, due to Apple iBooks / Books.app setting a precedent (authored FXL books with non-linear cover image as first spine item do exist, unfortunately this breaks spread left/right ordering if we apply the logical interpretation of linear=no :(
* feat: added highlight text before/after raw (not normalised with whitespace collapse) in existing data structure (actual engine changes in navigator component)
